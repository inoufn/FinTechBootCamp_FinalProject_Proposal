    "Our project is a service provided by an Insurance company using an insurance application. The idea is to send distress signals to the emergency in the event of an accident or fire (a life-saving service).\n",
    "The clientâ€™s health data will be entered within the application then, the data will be stored in the Blocks using Blockchain technology. In critical situations, when the sensor discovers anything abnormal, the application sends a signal to the nearest hospital to help the injured by using the IoT.\n",
